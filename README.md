I've been researching various workflows for using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for a personal blog site.

## PROs:
- Hugo generates static content so no database is required and containerizing the static output is trivial.
- There's a nice selection of themes and plugins.
- Creating and editing posts is a straight forward process.

## CONs:
- Familiarizing yourself with Hugo is mandatory. While not difficult, it's does require some finesse to get exactly what results you want.
- The documentation isn't a robust as I would hope. Perhaps I'm just looking in the wrong places though or I need to better familiarize mysefl with Hugo.
